## About
This is my solution for the the challenge of building an NFT card component from [Frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io).

The goal for the challenge is to practice my skills in HTML and CSS and be able to build out a component design mockup from scratch.

## User Stories
The user should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for interactive elements.

## Built with
- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- SASS

## Usage
You can download the project files by clicking on the green **Code** button, then select **Download Zip**.

Once you finish extracting, open the terminal, move into the project directory, and type the following code:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies.

To compile Sass into CSS and watch for any future changes, type the following code in your terminal:


```
npm run sass
```

To compile Sass into a minified version of CSS, run:

```
npm run prod
```
